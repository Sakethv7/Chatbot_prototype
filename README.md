# Financial Chatbot

## Overview

This project is a **Financial Chatbot** designed to assist users in understanding financial reports, such as 10-K and 10-Q reports, and answering general financial queries. The chatbot is built using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and various machine learning models to extract, analyze, and present financial data in a user-friendly format.

The project aims to improve user engagement and provide instant responses to finance-related queries through advanced AI-powered solutions.

## Features

- **Financial Data Extraction**: Automatically extracts key financial metrics from reports.
- **Natural Language Processing**: Understands and processes user queries related to finance.
- **Interactive Responses**: Provides meaningful insights and answers based on user queries.
- **Scalable Solution**: Designed to handle large financial datasets with high efficiency.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive design, making it accessible for both professionals and non-experts.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.8+**
- **Git**
- **pip** (Python package installer)

You'll also need access to the following services:
- **OpenAI API** for NLP processing (optional)
- **GitHub** for version control
- **AWS** or any cloud service for deployment (optional)

### Installation

Follow these steps to clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies.

1. **Clone the Repository**

```
git clone https://github.com/Sakethv7/Financial_chatbot.git
cd Financial_chatbot
```

# Create and Activate a Virtual Environment
On Windows:

```
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```
on Mac:
```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```
# Install Required Packages

pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Once the environment is set up, you can start the chatbot by running the following command:

python chatbot.py
The chatbot will begin interacting with users via the terminal or web interface, depending on the implementation.

# Key Components
```
chatbot.py: Core application where the chatbot’s logic is defined. Handles user inputs, processes them through the NLP model, and generates responses.
requirements.txt: Lists Python packages needed for the project. Use this file to install dependencies quickly.
data/: Contains financial datasets used for training and testing.
models/: Stores trained machine learning models used by the chatbot for financial data analysis.
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks used during development for experiments and visualizations.
```
# How It Works
The chatbot uses natural language processing to understand user queries and respond intelligently based on financial data. Here's a high-level overview:

```
User Input: The user inputs a financial query (e.g., "What is the revenue of XYZ company in 2023?").
Data Processing: The input is processed through a trained NLP model, which parses and interprets the query.
Data Extraction: Relevant data is retrieved from financial documents or external databases.
Response Generation: The chatbot formulates an appropriate response and returns the answer to the user.
Sample Queries
"What is the net income of Tesla in 2022?"
"What are the total assets of Amazon as of Q3 2023?"
"Can you summarize the key financials in the 10-K report for Apple?"
Supported Financial Reports
10-K Reports: Comprehensive annual financial statements.
10-Q Reports: Quarterly financial reports.
```
